<b>Invaders</b>
======
<b>Basic Space Invaders clone written in Love2D</b>

<p>
<b>Language:</b> Lua (Love2D)
<b>IDE:</b> SublimeText
</p>
<p>
<b>Plans for the future:</b>
I am planning on creating a full space invaders game for January.
It WILL be playable and it will have multiple levels along with scores and a title screen/pause screen.
</p>
<p>
<b>Deadline?</b>
If I don't finish within the monthly deadline, that is okay. 
I will still continue to work on (and eventually finish) the project.

<p>
<b>What If I want to use your art?</b>
All graphics are created by me in Gimp, but you can feel free to use them in your own projects if you wish.
